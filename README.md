This is the replication package for the paper "Can We Trust the Actionable Guidance from Explainable AI Techniques in Defect Prediction?"

## Abstract

Despite advances in high-performance Software Defect Prediction (SDP) models, practitioners remain hesitant to adopt them due to opaque decision-making and a lack of actionable insights. Recent research has applied various explainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide explainable and actionable guidance for SDP results to address these limitations, but the trustworthiness of such guidance for practitioners has not been sufficiently investigated. Practitioners may question the feasibility of implementing the proposed changes, and if these changes fail to resolve predicted defects or prove inaccurate, their trust in the guidance may diminish. In this study, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of current XAI approaches for SDP across 32 releases of 9 large-scale projects, focusing on whether the guidance meets practitioners' expectations. Our findings reveal that their actionable guidance (i) does not guarantee that predicted defects are resolved; (ii) fails to pinpoint modifications required to resolve predicted defects; and (iii) deviates from the typical code changes practitioners make in their projects. These limitations indicate that the guidance is not yet reliable enough for developers to justify investing their limited debugging resources. We suggest that future XAI research for SDP incorporate feedback loops that offer clear rewards for practitioners' efforts, and propose a potential alternative approach utilizing counterfactual explanations.


## Requirements

We tested the code on the following environment:
- os: MacOS
- python 3.11.8

```txt
"scikit-learn>=1.5.2",
"lime>=0.2.0.1",
"seaborn>=0.13.2",
"mlxtend>=0.23.1",
"scipy>=1.14.1",
"natsort>=8.4.0",
"dice-ml>=0.11",
"xgboost>=2.1.1",
"bigml>=9.7.1",
"ipykernel>=6.29.5",
"python-dotenv>=1.0.1",
"tabulate>=0.9.0",
"cliffs-delta>=1.0.0",
"rpy2>=3.5.16",
```

### Preprocessing

If you want to preprocess the dataset, you need to install the following dependencies:

```txt
R # for AutoSpearman
AutoSpearman # for feature selection
rpy2 
```
Our preprocessing steps include:
- Generate (k-1 , k) release (train, test) dataset from original dataset (Yatish et al.)
- Feature selection using AutoSpearman

or you can just use the preprocessed dataset in `Dataset/release_dataset`

## [Dataset](./Dataset/README.md)

## [Baselines](./Explainer/README.md)

## Training
```bash
python train_models.py
```
This script trains the models for each project and stores them in the `models` folder.

## Run Explainers to generate proposed changes
for LIME-HPO and TimeLIME: 2 steps
```bash
python run_explainers.py --explainer "LIMEHPO" --model "RandomForest" --project "activemq@2"
python plan_explanations.py --explainer "LIMEHPO" --model "RandomForest" --project "activemq@2"
```
The first step generates the explanation-based proposed changes, and the second step generates the all possible changes or the minimum changes.

for SQAPlanner: 3 steps
```bash
python run_explainers.py --explainer "SQAPlanner" --model "RandomForest" --project "activemq@2"
python mining_sqa_rules.py --project "activemq@2" --search_strategy confidence --model "RandomForest" 
python plan_explanations.py --explainer "SQAPlanner" --search_strategy confidence --model "RandomForest" --project "activemq@2"
```
The first step generates random neighbor instances using training data, and the second step generates the association rules using BigML API. The third step generates the explanation-based proposed changes. `.env` file is required to use BigML API key.

```.env
BIGML_USERNAME=YOUR_USERNAME
BIGML_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Simulation and Evaluation

```bash
python flip_exp.py --explainer "TimeLIME" --model "RandomForest" 
```


## Research Questions Replication

- RQ1: Can the implementation of actionable guidance for SDP guarantee changes in predictions?
- RQ2: Does the guidance accurately suggest modifications that lead to prediction changes?
- RQ3: Can the techniques suggest changes that align with these typically made by practitioners in their projects?

```bash
python evaluate.py --rq1 --rq2 --rq3 --implications
python analysis.py --rq1 --rq2 --rq3 --implications # for statistical analysis and plots
```
